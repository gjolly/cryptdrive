- Enforce file size limits on uploads and quota limits based on user tier
- Show tier 0 (free) limitations in the UI - especially the retention period for 24h
- Review the use of the public key vs user ID in the authentication and rate limiting logic to ensure consistency and security
- Allow users to delete their account and all associated data
- Don't use "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" on every request, create the table during a setup phase or check for its existence in a more efficient way
- User better rate limiting, probably involving CAPTCHAs for unauthenticated endpoints
- Add tests for positive /auth/token and replay attacks
- Fix test slowness due to reliance on R2.
- Fix CI failures due to connection to R2
- Add loading indicators when derivating keys, etc... to notify users of ongoing processes
- Improve the UI for shared links. These users should never see the landing page but something more generic "Download starting..." and "Download started..."
