- Steam encryption process to avoid loading large files into memory
- Enforce file size limits on uploads and quota limits based on user tier
- Redirect to R2 signed URLs for uploads and downloads instead of proxying through the worker
- Securely manage sensitive environment variables like SERVER_PEPPER and JWT_SECRET
- Show tier 0 (free) limitations in the UI - especially the retention period for 24h
- Apply linting and formatting standards across the codebase
- Develop a CI (Github and Cloudflare worker integration) pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Put API on /api path to allow the frontend to use a wider range of paths without conflicting with API routes (e.g., /file/{file_id} for file download)
- Review the use of the public key vs user ID in the authentication and rate limiting logic to ensure consistency and security
