- Steam encryption process to avoid loading large files into memory
- Enforce file size limits on uploads and quota limits based on user tier
- Redirect to R2 signed URLs for uploads and downloads instead of proxying through the worker
- Show tier 0 (free) limitations in the UI - especially the retention period for 24h
- Review the use of the public key vs user ID in the authentication and rate limiting logic to ensure consistency and security
- Only allow unauthenticated file download for files that have been shared to avoid listing attacks
- Allow users to delete their account and all associated data
- Don't use "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" on every request, create the table during a setup phase or check for its existence in a more efficient way
- User better rate limiting, probably involving CAPTCHAs for unauthenticated endpoints
- Add tests for positive /auth/token and replay attacks
