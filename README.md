# Cryptdrive

Cryptdrive is a secure, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage solution built on top of Cloudflare Workers and R2. It allows users to store their files in the cloud while ensuring that only they can access their data, as all encryption and decryption operations are performed client-side.

The app is currently available at https://cryptdrive.gauthier.workers.dev.

## Disclaimer

This project is a personal experiment and should not be used to store sensitive data without proper security audits. While I have taken measures to secure the application, there may still be vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Use at your own risk.

The project is under active development, expect data loss and breaking changes.
